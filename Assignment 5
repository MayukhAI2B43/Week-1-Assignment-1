Rotate Array by One
Difficulty: Basic  Accuracy: 69.6%  Submissions: 322K+  Points: 1  Average Time: 20m
Given an array arr, rotate the array by one position in clockwise direction.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation: If we rotate arr by one position in clockwise 5 come to the front and remaining those are shifted to the end.
Input: arr[] = [9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3]
Output: [3, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1]
Explanation: After rotating clock-wise 3 comes in first position.
Constraints:
1<=arr.size()<=105
0<=arr[i]<=105

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
