Difficulty: Easy  Accuracy: 64.19%  Submissions: 190+  Points: 2
Given an array arr[] of positive integers which may contain duplicate elements, return the frequency of each distinct element.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5]
Output: [[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 2], [5, 1]]
Explaiantion: Here element 1 and 5 occur 1 times, 2 and 3 occur 2 times.
Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 6, 7, 7]
Output: [[1, 1], [5, 1], [6, 1], [7, 2]]
Explanation: Here element 1, 5 and 6 occur 1 times, 7 occur 2 times.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Code in Python3:-
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def countFreq(self, arr):
        freq = Counter(arr)
        result = [[key, value] for key, value in sorted(freq.items())]
        return result
